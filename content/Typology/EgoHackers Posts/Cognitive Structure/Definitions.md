- id - a person's base impulses/instincts. Operates on the pleasure principle. Seeks to fulfill basic needs like food, sleep, sex, etc. Also drives all autonomic functions like breathing, heartbeat, etc.

- Shadow - a dark reflection of the ego. This corresponds to the unconscious/shadow in 4 sides of the mind.

- Superego - the complete opposite of one's own personality. Has the shadow's cognitive functions, but in upside-down order (like the ego with the subconscious).
