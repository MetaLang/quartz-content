See ![[Argument for why we are born UDUF]]
I think being UDUF makes it harder for others to type you, but easier for you to type yourself, because being UD allows you to step out of your ego and look at yourself from a different perspective. Probably UD and UF are more oriented toward "self awareness", and SD and SF are the opposite.

- SDSF -> very little to no self-awareness.
- SDUF -> becoming self-aware. You start to realize things about yourself that you don't like.
- UDUF -> being very self-conscious, to your detriment. You're aware of all your flaws.
- UDSF -> climbing out of the valley of self-consciousness. Still very self-aware but more accepting of your flaws.

To further extend this, the thought just occurred to me that maybe the superego is necessary to be self-aware at all. Why are (most?) animals not self-aware? As far as we know, they cannot self-reflect like humans can; they operate solely on primal instinct.

As I hypothesized, being UDUF may make it easier to step outside your ego and look inward at yourself. Maybe this is the mechanism through which we gained sentience. Chase likens accessing the superego's power to making a deal with the devil... and I can't describe humanity's gain of self-awareness in exchange for all of the problems that come with it as anything other than a Faustian bargain.
