There are multiple different function axes: cognitive orbit, cognitive axis, and cognitive reflection (take note: this is all according to CSJ's 4 sides of the mind system). Cognitive orbit is between Ti and Te, Ni and Ne, etc. Cognitive axis is between Ti and Fe, Ni and Se, etc. Cognitive reflection is between Ti and Fi, Ni and Si, etc. These are all different ways that information flows between the cognitive functions within your psyche.

You can see this illustrated in the diagram below:

The cool part that falls out of this diagram naturally - and which I think is actually true - is that the structure of the psyche is held up by the neutral functions that connect the positive Hero with the negative Demon (same for the positive Child and negative Critic).

A positive function cannot be connected directly to a negative one, as that would create a "short" in the "circuit". However, information/energy _can_ flow between positive and negative functions via the neutral intermediary functions, using cognitive axis and orbit.
